# Automate OpenVPN Connection on Kali Linux Startup

This guide will help you automate the execution of an OpenVPN `.ovpn` configuration file on startup in Kali Linux using systemd. This is particularly useful for connecting to TryHackMe's Target VMs or any other VPN services that require an OpenVPN connection.

## Steps

### 1. Move the `.ovpn` file to the OpenVPN directory

First, move your `.ovpn` configuration file to the `/etc/openvpn/` directory. This step requires superuser privileges.

```bash
sudo mv /path/to/yourfile.ovpn /etc/openvpn/client.conf
```

### 2. Create a systemd service

Create a new systemd service file for OpenVPN by creating a new file in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/openvpn-client.service
```

Add the following content to the service file:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=OpenVPN connection to TryHackMe
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/client.conf
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### 3. Reload systemd

After creating the service file, reload the systemd manager configuration.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### 4. Enable the service

Enable the service to start at boot.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable openvpn-client.service
```

### 5. Start the service

Start the service immediately.

```bash
sudo systemctl start openvpn-client.service
```

## Additional Tips

- **Check the service status**: You can check if the service is running properly by using:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status openvpn-client.service
  ```

- **Logs**: If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs for the service:

  ```bash
  journalctl -u openvpn-client.service
  ```

By following these steps, you'll have a systemd service that automatically runs your OpenVPN configuration at startup, ensuring a seamless connection to TryHackMe's Target VMs.
